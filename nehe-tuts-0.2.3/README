These examples were created by Jeff Molofee '99 NeHe of http://nehe.gamedev.net

Converted to Haskell by Jason Dagit, 2005 and 2011.

This code is tested on OSX, linux, Windows.  If you try it on
another platform and it works for you, then please let me know.

The current version uses GLFW via the GLFW-b bindings.  Instead of
using the OpenGL bindings, I use OpenGLRaw and GLURaw.  These packages
provide an API that is closer to the C API for OpenGL making it
easier to follow 3rd party documenatation and port examples.

Acknowldegements:
I want to thank #haskell on irc.freenode.net for support and general
help.  Especially to Lemmih for supplying example code.
